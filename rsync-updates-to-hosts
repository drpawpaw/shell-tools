# Keeps a dir hierarchy on set of remote hosts in sync with the same dir on
# the host it runs on. On each synced host only the files it already has in
# common with the source host are synced. No files on the synced hosts are
# deleted or moved. If the same file on the source and a synced host is moved
# on either it's only synced if moved to the same location on both. Uses a
# text file for 'rysnc' exclude patterns.

# Example excludes file:
#
## One rsync 'exclude' cmd line param per line.
