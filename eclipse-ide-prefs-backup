# Backs up all Eclipse IDE workspace preferences for reuse in other workspaces
# or Eclipse environments.

# Eclipse preferences are not Eclipse installation-based, but workspace-based,
# meaning they are saved below the directory dedicated to maintaining the state
# of a specific Eclipse workspace. This allows one Eclipse installation to
# support a wide variety of distinct tool sets, providing a clean distinction
# between workspaces (toolsets) dedicated to different primary languages or
# frameworks, such as Java vs. C/C++, or DSL vs. web design.

# An Eclipse workspace dir is one in which Eclipse, at least by default, places
# the root directory of projects created when the workspace is the active one.
# For this script's purpose, it's also the dir that contains a .metadata dir,
# where workspace state is maintained, including preferences. The workspace
# dir (NOT its settings/prefs dir) is the first arg to this script.

# Script is based on
# http://techtracer.com/2011/08/29/how-to-migrate-preferences-of-one-eclipse-workspace-to-another/
